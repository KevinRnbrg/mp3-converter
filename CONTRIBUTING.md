## Standards and Guide
Use [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) as a guideline when making pull requests.

Branch naming should be done like "type/short-change-description".
Branch types are:
* `feature/` New functionality or enhancement.
* `bugfix/` Fixes for non-critical bugs.
* `hotfix/` Urgent fixes.
* `chore/` Routine tasks like updating dependencies, code formatting.
* `refactor/` Code restructuring without behavior change.
* `test/` Changes related to testing (e.g., adding test cases, test infrastructure).
* `docs/` Documentation changes.
* `perf/` Performance improvements.
* `revert/` Reverting previously merged changes.
